## Struggles
My biggest struggle for this assignment was mySQL databases, the biggest help in this area was definitely youtube video's and articles online, in particular i was helped the most by this video **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3qvj9hO_Bo&t=2446s**, another struggle for me was trying to follow along with the actual module course work. It seemed sort of out of date and overly advanced for beginners to be blunt.
